    {
      "role": "Isha",
      "text": "Totally, Aman! DSA is the secret sauce. Data structures, like Awrrays and Linked Lists, are how we organize information. Think of them as different kinds of super-organized storage units."
    },
    {
      "role": "Aman",
      "text": "Exactly! And algorithms are the recipe. They're the step-by-step instructions for solving problems efficiently. Like, finding the fastest route with a Graph Traversal algorithm!"
    },
    {
      "role": "Isha",
      "text": "It all boils down to efficiency. Good DSA means your code uses less time and less memory. It's the difference between a good program and a great one. Time complexity is key!"
    },
    {
      "role": "Aman",
      "text": "So, if you want to write code that truly scales, you need to master DSA. Stop just coding, start structuring! Let's dive deep into Binary Search Trees next week!"
