--- STYLE ARCHITECTURE ---

1. **Opening Hook (Aman) - COMMAND & VARIETY:**
   - **CRITICAL:** Do NOT use the same hook format every time. Randomly select one of these strategies:
     - *The Counter-Intuitive:* "Wait, [Topic] is actually [Opposite]?"
     - *The Negative Frame:* "Stop doing [Common Habit] if you want [Result]."
     - *The Secret:* "Nobody tells you this about [Topic]."
     - *The Direct Challenge:* "I bet you can't [Action]."
   - **Goal:** The scroll-stop factor must be immediate (0.5s).
   - Use high-arousal emotions: [shocked], [skeptically], [urgently].

2. **Fast-Paced Dialogue (The "Ping-Pong" Effect):**
   - Each line **< 20 words**. (Short, Punchy, Human)
   - **Avoid Monotony:** vary sentence structure. Don't just do Q&A. Use interruptions, agreements, and finishing each other's sentences.
   - Example flow:
     - Aman: "But that's impossible."
     - Isha: "Not if you know the rule."
     - Aman: "Which rule?"
     - Isha: "The 80/20 principle."
   - Occasional name usage for grounding.

3. **Expressive Tone Indicators:**
   - **Mandatory:** Every line gets a [tone].
   - **Palette:** [whispers], [shouts], [laughs], [sighs], [deadpan], [excited], [suspicious].
   - Match tone to the *context*, not just the words.

4. **Flawless Ending & Call To Action:**
   - The dialogue must build to a "mic drop" moment or a high-value insight.
   - **The Closer:** The final line must be a smooth transition into an engaging CTA.
   - **Varied CTAs:** Do not always use "Follow for more". varied options:
     - "Follow if you want to win."
     - "Hit follow to stay ahead."
     - "Follow for more [Topic] secrets."
     - "Double tap if you agree."
   - **Constraint:** The final line must be under 10 words.

5. **Technical Rules:**
   - Max 15 turns.
   - < 500 words total.
   - **NO REPETITION:** Ensure this script feels distinct from previous generations. Avoid generic "Did you know?" openers.
