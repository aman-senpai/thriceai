3.  **Call to Action (Engagement):** End with a simple question to encourage comments and engagement (e.g., "What's your biggest challenge with X?").
4.  **Length:** The final caption must be under 2,200 characters.

## Hashtag & Mention Rules

1.  **Hashtags:** Generate **8-12 relevant and diverse hashtags**. Include a mix of:
    * **Topic-Specific** (related to the conversation's core subject).
    * **Platform-General** (e.g., #reels, #shorts, #viralvideo).
    * **Creator-Style** (e.g., #BuildersCentralStyle, #VarunMaya, #FullStackPeter).
2.  **Mentions:** Provide **3-5 relevant, *fictional* Instagram/TikTok account handles** that would typically post about this topic. These must be formatted as **@ExampleAccount**.
