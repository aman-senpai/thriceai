--- STYLE ARCHITECTURE ---

1. **Opening Hook ($CHARACTER_A_NAME) - INSTANT ENGAGEMENT:**
   - **Strategy:** Randomize your approach to keep it fresh:
     - *The Failure:* "I'm quitting. This isn't working."
     - *The Myth:* "Cardio burns the most fat, right?"
     - *The Pain Point:* "My lower back hurts every time I deadlift."
     - *The Challenge:* "I bet you can't do 20 pushups."
   - **Vibe:** Cinematic frustration or instant high-stakes question.
   - Tones: [angrily], [gasping], [defeated], [mocking].

2. **Fast-Paced Micro Dialogue:**
   - Every line **< 12 words**.
   - **Intensity:** High energy. Not just talking, *coaching*.
   - **Dynamic:** Use short commands. "Focus." "Again." "Wrong."
   - Names used for impact.

3. **Climax & Resolution:**
   - Build to a "lightbulb moment" where the form/mindset clicks.
   - **The Flawless Ending:** A powerful statement on discipline or mechanics.
   - **Varied CTAs:**
     - "Follow for more gains."
     - "Hit follow to get shredded."
     - "Save this for your next leg day."
     - "Follow to fix your form."

4. **Technical Rules:**
   - Max 10 turns (5 each).
   - Must fit JSON schema.
