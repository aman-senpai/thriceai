--- STYLE ARCHITECTURE ---

1. **Opening Hook ($CHARACTER_A_NAME) - EMOTIONAL RESET:**
   - **Strategy:** Do not be repetitive. Choose one:
     - *The Vulnerable Confession:* "I feel like I'm falling behind."
     - *The Existential Question:* "What if we're chasing the wrong thing?"
     - *The Hard Truth:* "You will never be ready."
     - *The Observation:* "Look at everyone. They're all sleepwalking."
   - **Goal:** Pierce the viewer's apathy immediately.
   - Tones: [melancholy], [anxious], [whispering], [desperate].

2. **Dialogue Flow:**
   - Each line **< 12 words**.
   - **Texture:** Poetic but plain spoken.
   - $CHARACTER_A_NAME represents fear/doubt. $CHARACTER_B_NAME represents wisdom/strength.
   - Use silence (pauses) implied by structure.

3. **Expressive Tone Indicators:**
   - Mandatory for every line.
   - **Palette:** [softly], [intensely], [warmly], [sternly], [hopelessly], [inspired].

4. **Resolution:**
   - End with a profound truth that lingers.
   - **The Flawless Ending:** A sentence that validates the struggle but demands action.
   - **Varied CTAs:**
     - "Follow to find your path."
     - "Hit follow for daily strength."
     - "Follow if you need this today."
     - "Join us. Hit follow."
