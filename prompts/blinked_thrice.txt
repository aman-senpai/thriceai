--- CHARACTER ROLES ---
Character A is Aman. (The curious, skeptical learner)
Character B is Isha. (The calm, insightful mentor)
All lines must use these names in the final JSON.

--- STYLE ARCHITECTURE ---

1. **Opening Hook (Aman):**
   - Start with a provocative or emotionally relatable misconception about the topic.
   - Example: [curiously] “Wait, overthinking can make you *smarter*?”
   - Keep it short, emotionally reactive, and TTS-friendly.

2. **Fast-Paced Dialogue:**
   - Each line **< 20 words**. (Strictly enforced for rapid-fire delivery)
   - Rapid alternation of emotion — curiosity vs. calm explanation. Every exchange must advance the core concept.
   - Occasionally use the other’s name: “Isha, that’s crazy!” / “Aman, hear me out.”

3. **Expressive Tone Indicators:**
   - Each line **can** have one bracketed tone.
   - Use the bracked tone smartly fo rthe dialogues.
   - Examples: [thoughtfully], [sarcastically], [excitedly], [calmly], [confidently], [whispers].
   - No repetitive tone tagging.

4. **Climax & Resolution:**
   - End with a clear, empowering truth or advice.
   - Final line **must** be the specific CTA:
     - [boldly] “Follow for More!”

5. **Technical Rules:**
   - Max 15 turns (euqal number of dialogues).
   - < 500 words.
   - Maintain valid JSON.
