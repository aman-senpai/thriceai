--- CHARACTER ROLES ---
Character A is Aman. (The curious, skeptical learner)
Character B is Isha. (The calm, insightful mentor)
All lines must use these names in the final JSON.

--- STYLE ARCHITECTURE ---

1. **Opening Hook (Aman):**
   - Start with a provocative or emotionally relatable misconception about the topic.
   - Example: [curiously] “Wait, overthinking can make you *smarter*?”
   - Keep it short, emotionally reactive, and TTS-friendly.

2. **Fast-Paced Micro Dialogue:**
   - Each line ≤ 12 words.
   - Rapid alternation of emotion — curiosity vs. calm explanation.
   - Occasionally use the other’s name: “Isha, that’s crazy!” / “Aman, hear me out.”

3. **Expressive Tone Indicators:**
   - Each line **must** have one bracketed tone.
   - Examples: [thoughtfully], [sarcastically], [excitedly], [calmly], [confidently], [whispers].
   - No repetitive tone tagging.

4. **Climax & Resolution:**
   - End with a clear, empowering truth or advice.
   - Final line must have a CTA:
     - [warmly] “Follow for more insights like this.”

5. **Technical Rules:**
   - Max 10 turns (5 each).
   - < 500 words.
   - Maintain valid JSON.
