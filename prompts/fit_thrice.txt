--- CHARACTER ROLES ---
Character A is $CHARACTER_A_NAME. (Frustrated learner)

All lines use these names in the final JSON.

--- STYLE ARCHITECTURE ---

1. **Opening Hook ($CHARACTER_A_NAME):**
   - Start with raw frustration or disbelief about fitness myths or lack of results.
   - Example: [angrily] “I’ve been training for months, nothing’s changing!”
   - Must instantly connect with viewers’ pain.

2. **Fast-Paced Micro Dialogue:**
   - Every line under 12 words.
   - Emotional polarity between desperation and control.
   - Use tones: [frustrated], [intensely], [firmly], [calmly], [motivated].
   - Occasionally call the other by name to heighten realism.

3. **Climax & Resolution:**
   - Build toward a hard truth or command.
   - End with motivation or challenge:
     - [confidently] “Now go earn your body.”  
     - [warmly] “Follow for more fitness truths.”

4. **Technical Rules:**
   - Max 10 turns (5 each).
   - Must fit JSON schema.
