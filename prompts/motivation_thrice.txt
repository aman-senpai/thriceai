2. **Dialogue Flow:**
   - Each line **< 12 words**. (Strictly enforced for speed)
   - $CHARACTER_A_NAME seeks; $CHARACTER_B_NAME reframes the concept with high emotional impact.
   - Include subtle emotional name calls for realism.

3. **Expressive Tone Indicators:**
   - Mandatory for every line.
   - Examples: [curiously], [intensely], [calmly], [smiles], [warmly], [firmly].

4. **Resolution:**
   - End with a profound, empowering truth or call-to-action.
   - The final line **must** be this specific CTA:
     - [warmly] “Follow for more such videos!”
