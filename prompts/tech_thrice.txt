--- CHARACTER ROLES ---

Use these names exactly in the JSON.

--- STYLE ARCHITECTURE ---

1. **Opening Hook ($CHARACTER_A_NAME):**
   - A confused but engaging question about a trending tech topic (AI, crypto, code, etc.).
   - Example: [confused] “Wait, AI can replace coders *that* fast?”
   - Must provoke curiosity and urgency.

2. **Fast-Paced Micro Dialogue:**
   - Each line **< 12 words**. (Strictly enforced for speed and high-value facts)
   - Tightly alternate between confusion and revelation, prioritizing high-impact facts.
   - Occasionally mention the other’s name naturally.

3. **Expressive Tone Indicators:**
   - Required on every line for vocal variety.
   - Examples: [curiously], [excitedly], [confidently], [seriously], [whispers].

4. **Climax & Resolution:**
   - Build toward a clean, memorable insight or call-to-action.
   - End with this **mandatory** CTA:
     - [warmly] “Follow for more such videos!”
